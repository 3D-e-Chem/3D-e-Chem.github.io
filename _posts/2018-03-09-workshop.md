The 3D-e-Chem team joined the [KNIME spring summit](https://www.knime.com/about/events/knime-spring-summit-2018-berlin) in Berlin again, but this time with two oral presentations, one poster presentation, and a hands-on workshop!

On Tuesday [Stefan Verhoeven](http://3d-e-chem.github.io/team/stefan_verhoeven/) presented and demonstrated "KNIME node development: Maven and Tycho" during the developer meeting. [Chris de Graaf](http://3d-e-chem.github.io/team/Chris_de_Graaf/) provided a comprehensive overview of the 3D-e-Chem project during an invited oral presentation entitled "KNIME Structural Cheminformatics Workflows for Computer-Aided Drug Discovery" on Thursday morning, and in the evening the team presented their latest work with a poster entitled "Structural Cheminformatics Workflows for Computer-Aided Drug Discovery". Finally, on the last day of the summit, [MÃ¡rton Vass](http://3d-e-chem.github.io/team/Marton_Vass/) and [Albert J. Kooistra](http://3d-e-chem.github.io/team/Albert_Kooistra/) held a (hands-on) workshop titled "3D-e-Chem KNIME Nodes for Integrated Structural Cheminformatics Analysis and Computer-Aided Drug Discovery".

It was another great KNIME summit, which clearly showed that there are many exciting developments on hand.
