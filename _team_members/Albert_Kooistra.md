Albert J. Kooistra obtained his B.Sc. degree in Telematics at the University of Twente, his M.Sc. degree (cum laude) in Bioinformatics, and his Ph.D. in computational Medicinal Chemistry at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and worked for several years as a software designer and developer. He carried out his Ph.D. research from 2010-2014 in the Division of Medicinal Chemistry on the development of virtual screening tools and protocols for mainly GPCRs, as well as performing chemogenomic and structural analyses covering several protein families. As a postdoctoral researcher in the same division, he developed novel in silico approaches for  knowledge and structure-based steering of medicinal chemistry efforts. Dr. Kooistra is also one of the founders of the structural chemogenomics kinase databases KLIFS (<a href="http://klifs.vu-compmedchem.nl">http://klifs.vu-compmedchem.nl</a>) and phosphodiesterase PDEStrIAn (<a href="http://pdestrian.vu-compmedchem.nl">http://pdestrian.vu-compmedchem.nl</a>). In April 2016 he joined the CMBI to collaborate within <a href="http://3d-e-chem.github.io">the 3D-e-Chem project</a>; a collaboration between the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, CMBI (Radboud UMC), and the Netherlands eScience center which aims to develop new technologies to improve the integration of ligand and protein data for structure-based prediction of protein-ligand selectivity and polypharmacology.
