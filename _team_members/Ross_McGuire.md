Ross McGuire has a background in synthetic organic chemistry gaining a PhD on novel heterocyclization reactions at the University of Edinburgh.
He has worked for Rhône-Poulenc in England and France, as well as for Organon in Scotland and the Netherlands as a computational chemist in multiple drug discovery projects in a variety of therapeutic areas, including CNS, CV, Neuromuscular Relaxation drugs and their reversal agents. 
In 2000, he moved to Organon’s Oss research centre in the Netherlands, where he was made head of in silico Drug Design in 2002. 
IN 2003 he led the introduction of x-ray crystallography and SBDD at Organon (later Schering-Plough/MSD) and was leader of a multidisciplinary group of 12 PhD level scientists with expertise in modelling, chem/bio-informatics and Structure-Based Drug Design. 
In 2011 he founded the successful European cheminformatics and computational medicinal chemistry consultancy, BioAxis Research BV and currently also holds a position at the Radboud University Medical Center in Nijmegen.

In the 3D-e-Chem project Ross is involved in the development of the 3D-e-Chem workflow and the incorporation of bio/cheminformatics tools.
