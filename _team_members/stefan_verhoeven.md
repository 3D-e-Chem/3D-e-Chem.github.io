Stefan worked a decade within the Bioinformatics/Cheminformatics department in the pharma industry, where he administrated the Unix infrastructure and maintained/developed applications. Stefan helped scientists run their computations on clusters and maintained bioinformatics tools.
Most of the applications he made use a rich web interface or are web service based.

Stefan joined the Netherlands eScience Center as eScience Engineer, specialized in software development for life science projects.

In the 3D-e-Chem project Stefan will develop Knime nodes to integrate the different applications in a workflow. He will also maintain a <a href="https://3d-e-chem.github.io/3D-e-Chem-VM">Virtual Machine</a> which can be used to get all the software required to run 3D-e-Chem workflows.
